# Office 2016 Uninstaller for macOS

Be careful and read about the source code. If you run this script without modification, **ALL** Office data will be removed.

From [here](https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/discussions/20562/office-2016-removal-script), very helpful to get rid of Microsoft Office from my Mac. You may need `sudo` to remove the application files.

Again, always **read the source code** before you run a script. If it's too long to read, search for the `rm` parts.
